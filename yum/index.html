		<h2>Broccolini with Lemon Oil</h2>
		<nav>Serves 10-12</nav>
	</header>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul class='menu'>
			<li><a href="#">1 large lemon</a></li>
			<li><a href="#">1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</a></li>
			<li><a href="#">3 lb Broccolini (6 bunches), trimmed and thick stalks halved lengthwise</a></li>
			<li><a href="#">Accompaniment: lemon wedges</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Preparation</h4>
		<p>	
			Remove zest from lemon in 1-inch-wide strips with a vegetable peeler. Cut off any white pith from zest with a small sharp knife. Halve lemon and set aside.
			Heat oil and zest in a 5-quart wide heavy pot over moderate heat until zest is golden, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and discard zest, reserving oil in pot.
			Cook Broccolini in an 8-to 10-quart pot two-thirds full of boiling salted water, uncovered, until crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain well in a large colander.
			Reheat lemon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Add Broccolini and cook, tossing, until coated well and heated through, about 1 minute. Add salt and pepper to taste, then squeeze half of lemon over Broccolini. (Reserve remaining lemon half for another use.)</p>
